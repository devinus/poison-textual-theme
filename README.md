# Poison - A [Textual](https://github.com/Codeux/Textual) Theme

A theme based on the beautiful
[Poised theme](https://github.com/Agos/Poised-theme) by Agostino Carandente
for Textual 2.1.

I've only dropped the dependency on jQuery and optimized the background image.
I know I have problems--no need to tell me.

## Install

```sh-session
$ git clone git://github.com/devinus/poison-textual-theme ~/Library/Containers/com.codeux.irc.textual/Data/Library/Application\ Support/Textual\ IRC/Styles/Poison
```
